# Palindrome_string
### Python program to check whether the string is a palindrome or not.

Palindrome is a word or a sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards.  
A python program is created to check if the string entered by the user is a **palindrome** or not. If the string is palindrome the condition returns *'True'*, otherwise the condition 
returns *'False'*.   
First program implements all the conditions for using a *'stack'* whereas, the second one is a bit optimized.

**FOR EXAMPLE:**  
If the user enters *"dad"*, the output console will display:  
***"The string is a palindrome."***  
Whereas, if the user enters *"car"*, the output console will display:  
***"The string is not a palindrome."***
